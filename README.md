without prior permission. We appreciate hearing about people using our mods, but you do not need to ask to use them. See
the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more details.

Parchment is a library that makes it easier for mods to run code in arbitrary scripting engines using JSR-223. It
provides interfaces both for mods to add their own JSR-223-compliant languages and scripts to load using those engines,
along with a template resource reload listener for mods using scripts in data-driven environments.
